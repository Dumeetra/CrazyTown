# CrazyTown 
 <p>Crazytown is a game in which cars are guided by the player to houses of the same color as the cars.  
 There is minimum one car and maximum ten.</h8></p>
 <p> The cars can turn right or left. If the car receives no mouse input (a mouse click) before an intersection, it continues going straight.</p>
 <h8> The directions are seen from the player's angle (not the driver's).</h8>
 <h8> The mouse input is as follows (I am left-handed):</h8>
> - Horizontal drive: turn up - press the left button
> - Horizotal drive: turn down - press the right button
> - Vertical drive: turn left - press the left button
> - Vertical drive: turn right - press the right button
<h8> There are 10 levels. The player chooses a level and enters it at the console.</h8>
<h8> The player also chooses the speed at the console.</h8>
<h8> Cars will stop, and so will the game, after a frontal collision.</h8>

<h8> mkdir build</h8>
