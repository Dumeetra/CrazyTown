# CrazyTown 
 ##### Crazytown is a game in which cars are guided by the player to houses of the same color as the cars.  
 ##### There is minimum one car and maximum ten.  
 The cars can turn right or left. If the car receives no mouse input (a mouse click) before an intersection, it continues going straight.  
 The directions are seen from the player's angle (not the driver's).  
 The mouse input is as follows (I am left-handed):</p>
> - Horizontal drive: turn up - press the left button
> - Horizotal drive: turn down - press the right button
> - Vertical drive: turn left - press the left button
> - Vertical drive: turn right - press the right button
<p> There are 10 levels. The player chooses a level and enters it at the console.  
 The player also chooses the speed at the console.  
 Cars will stop, and so will the game, after a frontal collision.</p>
