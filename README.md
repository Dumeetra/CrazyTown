# CrazyTown 
#Crazytown is a game in which cars are guided by the player to houses of the same color as the cars.
#There is minimum one car and maximum ten.
#The cars can turn right or left. If the car receives no mouse input (a mouse click) before an intersection, it continues going straight.
#The directions are seen from the player's angle (not the driver's)
#The mouse input is as follows (I am left-handed):
#Horizontal drive: turn up - press the left button
#Horizotal drive: turn down - press the right button
#Vertical drive: turn left - press the left button
#Vertical drive: turn right - press the right button
#There are 10 levels. The player chooses a level and enters it at the console.
#The player also chooses the speed at the console.
#Cars will stop, and so will the game, after a frontal collision.
